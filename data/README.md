# Data Files

These are `.rda` and `.tsv` files that produced by the analyses in `analyses/`.
They can for the most part be recreated by the Makefile `analyses/Makefile`,
and do not need to be in the main repository. We check them in so others can
play around with the results (except for some that are too large; see
`.gitignore` in the main directory).
